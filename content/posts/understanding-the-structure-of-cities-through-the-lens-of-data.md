## Annotation

Martin & James will walk you through the fundamentals of analysis of the structure of cities. You will learn what can be measured, how to do that in Python, and how to use those numbers to capture the patterns that make up cities. Using a real-life example, you will learn every step of the method, from data retrieval to detection of individual patterns.
